<h2>Who I Am</h2>
<p>I created this portfolio to show the skills I learned in web development. Using basic HTML
   and CSS from W3Schools, I learned to write clean code, apply consistent styling, add images,
   and build multi-page websites with responsive layouts.
</p>

<h2>My Growth</h2>
<p>At first, learning how HTML and CSS worked together was confusing, but with each lab,
  it became easier to understand. I learned how important structure tags and layout rules are
  for creating pages that are easy to read and navigate. This portfolio is the biggest project
  I created this semester.
</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>My goal is to continue improving my web development skills. This class gave me a strong
  foundation, and now I feel confident building websites on my own. I want to learn more about
  accessibility, design, and JavaScript in the future.
