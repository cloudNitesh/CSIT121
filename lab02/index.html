      <h3>My First HTML Page</h3>
      <p>
        This assignment helped me understand how to structure a webpage using semantic HTML
        elements. I learned how to organize content with headings, lists, and links. 
        I also learned how to create both ordered and unordered lists, and how to add links
        that open in a new tab.I have used VS Code to write the file and the W3C Validator to
        check for errors. Next I want to Learn how html work with css.

      <h3>What I Learned</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>About heading tags</li>
        <li>Ordered and Unordered list</li>
        <li>Inserting Links</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Learning about different tags was another exciting step. I learned a lot from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://web.dev/learn/html" target="_self">Web.dev Html</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/" target="_self">W3Schools HTML Tutorial</a></li>
      </ul>
