            <h3>My First HTML Page</h3>
            <p>
                This assignment helped me understand how to structure a webpage using semantic HTML
                elements. I learned how to organize content with headings, lists, and links.
                I also learned how to create both ordered and unordered lists, and how to add links
                that open in a new tab.I have used VS Code to write the file and the W3C Validator to
                check for errors. Next I want to Learn how html work with css.

            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>About heading tags</li>
                <li>Ordered and Unordered list</li>
                <li>Inserting Links</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Learning about different tags was another exciting step. I learned a lot from:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://web.dev/learn/html" target="_self">Web.dev Html</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/" target="_self">W3Schools HTML Tutorial</a></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Reflection for Lab 03</h3>
            <p id="note">
                In this lab, I learned how CSS can change the way a page looks without changing the content.
                I experimented with background colors, fonts, and link styles.
            </p>
            <p class="highlight">
                One important lesson was how IDs style a single unique element, while classes can be reused.
