            <h2>Reflection for Lab 02: HTML Basics</h2>
            <p>
                In this lab, I learned how to structure a webpage using basic HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs,
                lists, and links. I also practiced creating ordered and unordered lists and linking pages together.
                This was my first experience with writing HTML from scratch, and it helped me understand how content
                is organized on a webpage.

            <h2>Reflection for Lab 03: CSS Basics</h2>
            <p>
                In this lab, I learned how CSS can change how a webpage looks without touching the content. 
                I experimented with background colors, fonts, and text alignment.
                I also discovered the difference between using classes and IDs in CSS.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was a great step forward because it showed me how design and structure work together to make a 
                webpage look more professional and visually balanced.

            <h2>Reflection for Lab 05: Responsive Design</h2>
            <p>
                In this lab, I learned how to use CSS Flexbox and media queries to make a website responsive.
                My layout now changes from a single column on small screens to multiple columns on larger screens.
                I also added navigation links that jump directly to each blog post.
            </p>
            <p>
                I realized that good web design isn’t just about how it looks on one screen—it’s about making sure it 
                works well on all devices. Learning to test and adjust layouts made me more confident with responsive design.
